# AR Board Game Library

### Projects context:
 
The project consists into an application called AR Board Game Library based on google's latest SDK called ARCore where users enjoy the experience of playing a board game in reality with just using they're phones.


### Projects goal and purpose: 

The project called AR Board Game Library consists in integrating a library of multiple board games like Chess, Monopoly  Scrabble, Settlers of Catan and lots more that can be played with your friends in a lobby fashion where you use your own Android Smartphone camera to simulate all the pieces to a flat surface found in reality(let's say a table or the actual floor). The purpose of this app is to encourage real life meetings between friends in a modern fashion where they can have fun playing a board game without actually having the game with them. Board games can be fragile, they consists of multiple small pieces that can be lost and some of them can be expensive. This app removes all those disadvantages by making the users phones hold the actual board game and still keeping the fun of a board game by translating it into reality using the phone's camera.


### The project will have the following key features:
* A login system where you can use your facebook, google, microsoft accounts or a custom account.
* A lobby system where you can add your surrounding friends or somebody that is not there and still wants to enjoy the fun.
* A board game library in a modular fashion that consists in a collection of board games implemented specifically for this application. If possible that should contain a way for future developers to actually create they're own board game and add it to the application.
* Board creation mode: a tutorial for each user at the beginning of the game that will help them put all the pieces on a flat surface by using ARCore's motion tracking feature.
* Play mode: hardest part where the game logic found in game library module is used by the ARCore module to create an AR experience for the users.
* A streaming feature used in this project's presentation that can be enabled/disabled by the user.
